This project enables users to generate images from text prompts using OpenAI’s DALL·E model. 
It consists of a frontend where users can input their prompts and a backend that communicates with the OpenAI API to generate images based on those prompts.
The backend is built using Node.js and Express, while the frontend is developed with React.js. 
The application handles both the image generation process and error handling gracefully. 
You can easily set it up locally to start generating AI images from your own descriptions.
